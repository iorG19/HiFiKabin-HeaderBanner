Extension Name: Header Banner

Author: HiFiKabin

Extension Description:
Removes the content of the header replacing it with a banner of your choice that scales to the browser window. Undersized banners are centred on wide browser windows. The search (if enabled) can be placed on the header (top left/top right/bottom left/bottom right) moved to the NavBar or hidden.

You can hide the existing header background colour, radius the corners of the banner, as well as set its maximum size.

You can have a separate banner for mobile devices (<700px) if you wish

The banner is linked to the url that the site_logo is linked to, or you can specify a custom destination in the configuration page.

Notes:
The ACP screenshot shows the configuration page location
The image must be a standard image extension eg .jpg .gif .png etc
If you host the image on your own server, place it in the images directory in the form root. To ensure it will appear on all pages, please still enter the full URL eg http://mysite.com/images/banner.jpg
By setting the maximum width you can widen a small banner but it may distort of become pixilated.
Image is ALWAYS show at full width when using Internet Explorer
Compatible with my Google Search Extension
